/*

note that this thing may be running at the same time as the trial controller in order to control the left arm

would be good to have the following functionality:

1. go to a position (with maximum speed limit and high gains)

2. go to a position task space (Via J^T control)

3. hold position with variable stiffness

4. signal when at position with a timeout and variable stiffness (integral term?)
