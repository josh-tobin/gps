GPS
======

This code is a reimplementation of the guided policy search algorithm and LQG-based trajectory optimization, meant to help others understand, reuse, and build upon existing work.
It includes a complete robot controller and sensor interface for the PR2 robot via ROS, and an interface for simulated agents in Box2D and Mujoco.

While the core functionality is fully implemented and tested, the code base is **a work in progress**. See the [FAQ](faq.html) for information on planned future additions to the code.
